<p><strong><em>If you are located in the EU or UK, this section applies to you.</em></strong></p>

This approach aligns with our commitment to comply with the GDPR, CCPA, and other applicable privacy regulations.</p>

<p>We utilize the User Messaging Platform (UMP) SDK to manage consent preferences for our users concerning personalized and non-personalized ads in compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). Upon first use or any reset of ad preferences, users can select between personalized ads, non-personalized ads, or opting out of ads entirely.

<p>In some exceptional cases, we may be legally permitted under applicable law to process your information without your consent, including, for example: </p>
<ul>

<li>If it is contained in a witness statement and the collection is necessary to assess, process, or settle an insurance claim</li>
<li>For identifying injured, ill, or deceased persons and communicating with next of kin</li>
<li>If we have reasonable grounds to believe an individual has been, is, or may be victim of financial abuse </li>
<li>If it is reasonable to expect collection and use with consent would compromise the availability or the accuracy of the information and the collection is reasonable for purposes related to investigating a breach of an agreement or a contravention of the laws of Canada or a province</li>
<li>If disclosure is required to comply with a subpoena, warrant, court order, or rules of the court relating to the production of records</li>
<li>If it was produced by an individual in the course of their employment, business, or profession and the collection is consistent with the purposes for which the information was produced </li>
